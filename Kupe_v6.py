Welcome to Kupe's Discovery of Aoteroa

In this game you will travel across a board to discover the story of Kupe

While traversing the ocean, you will need to catch fish
but watchout, the more you fish on the same tile, the less fish there are to catch
One more thing, every two turns you will lose a fish
Every time you fish on a tile, the chance to catch a bonus fish will decrease, so keep moving



Good luck!
